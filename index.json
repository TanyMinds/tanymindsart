Atunci când emoțiile strigă la mine mă răstesc și eu la ele, să se tempereze un pic. Nu funcționează această strategie, de aceea le iau mai cu binișorul. La rândul lor încep să îmi comunice de ce sunt atât de bulversate și de ce se comportă urât cu mine. Ele apar cel mai des când nu conștientizez pe deplin situația, sau când mă ia ceva prin surprindere.\nÎmi place să țin sub control viața și lucrurile care mi se întâmplă. Cel mai des însă planurile nu coincid în totalitate cu realitatea. Atunci mă întâlnesc față în față cu uimirea care de cele mai multe ori se transformă în frustrare.\nCum este posibil să te ia prin surprindere ceva, dacă mereu planifici, planifici, planifici?\nSimplu, te folosești mereu de aceleași premize, cunoștințe și experiențe. Vrei să planifici viitorul folosind date din trecut. Și deoarece dezvoltarea societății nu ține cont doar de tine…. Surpriză!\nAcest lucru în sine nu poate fi schimbat. Poți schimba doar atitudinea cu care primești schimbarea în viața ta. Să vrei să te împaci cu această realitate. Desigur va trebui să faci ceva muncă de convingere și cu credințele tale. Va trebui să le analizezi un pic și să elimini credințele care îți sugerează că schimbarea este un lucru rău. Deoarece este foarte probabil să ai scris în gene ”schimbarea este ceva rău, ferește-te de ea”, ”este bine așa cum este acum, te simți confortabil, chiar dacă nu ești mulțumit de ce ți se înâmplă în viață”, ”mai bine vrabia din mână decât cioara de pe gard” sau alte cuvinte care te fac să te simți bine pentru moment.\nLa început este greu, dar odată cu experiența vei aștepta cu nerăbdare ceva nou, ceva care să îți miște inima din loc. Mi-au plăcut cuvintele spuse de fondatorul, președintele și CEO-ul FedEx, Fred Smith: ”Eşti aşa cum eşti pentru că aşa vrei să fii. Dacă realmente ai vrea să fii altfel, ai fi deja în plin proces de schimbare”.\nPhoto credit: Photo by Tany Minds Art https://tanymindsart.com\r","id":11,"image":"images/blog/about-change-when-emotions-scream-at-me.jpg","section":"blog","summary":"Când inima îmi bate mai cu putere, știu că trăiesc.

When the emotions are screaming at me, I am angry at them too, to temper a little. This strategy does not work, which is why I take them with the good. In turn, they start to tell me why they are so upset and why they behave badly with me. They most often occur when I am not fully aware of the situation, or when I am taken by surprise.\nI like to keep my life and the things that happen to me under control. Most often, however, the plans do not totally coincide with reality. Then I come face to face with the astonishment that most often turns into frustration.\nHow is it possible to be taken by surprise if you always planned, planned, planned?\nSimple, you always use the same premises, knowledge and experiences. You want to plan the future using data from the past. And because the development of the society is not just about you…. Surprise!\nThis in itself cannot be changed. You can only change the attitude with which you receive change in your life. You want to reconcile with this reality. Of course you will have to do some convincing work with your beliefs. You will need to analyze them a bit and remove the beliefs that suggest that change is a bad thing. Because it is very likely that you wrote in the genes “change is bad, stay away from it”, “it is good as it is now, you feel comfortable, even if you are not satisfied with what is happening in your life”, “it is better sparrow in hand than crow from the fence” or other words that make you feel good for the moment.\nAt first it is hard, but with the experience you will look forward to something new, something that will move your heart out of place. I liked the words of FedEx founder, president and CEO Fred Smith: “You are the way you are because you want to be that way. If you really wanted to be different, you would already be in the process of change.”\nPhoto credit: Photo by Tany Minds Art https://tanymindsart.com\r","id":12,"image":"images/blog/about-change-when-emotions-scream-at-me.jpg","section":"blog","summary":"When my heart beats more powerfully, I know I live.
