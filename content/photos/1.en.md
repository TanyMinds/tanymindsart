When my heart beats more powerfully, I know I live. When the emotions are screaming at me, I am angry at them too, to temper a little. This strategy does not work, which is why I take them with the good. In turn, they start to tell me why they are so upset and why they behave badly with me. They most often occur when I am not fully aware of the situation, or when I am taken by surprise.
