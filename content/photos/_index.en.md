description : "Happiness, positive thinking, labels, clich√©s, mistakes, anxiety, limiting beliefs, communication and the list goes on. It seems like a lot, but all of these and more are part of us. Most of it is subconscious. Here I want to bring them to the surface, make them known, make us aware of them, understand how they work and how we can use them to our benefit. At the same time I want to highlight the importance of balance between all aspects of life and continuous development so that along the way we don't lose sight of the dreams we are working towards, but also enjoy the journey itself."
